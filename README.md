# AoC22
Advent of Code (AoC) is back again!

Like previous year, trying to automate as much as possible with Excel, but witout any VB code.
Note that the overhead of Excel may not fit the initial statement from Eric Wastl that the solution can be found in less than 15 seconds on an "old" machine.

*The proposed solutions are without any guarantee than the one that they allowed me to get the correct response to my input data*

My input data are still reflected in the proposed sheets/morkbooks.
